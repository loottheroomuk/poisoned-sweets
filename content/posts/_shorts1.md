Prano Bailey-Bond's *Censor* comes out on blu-ray in the UK today. I've ordered it not only because the film is fantastic but also because the extras contain Prano's 2015 short *Nasty* . I saw it at Leeds International Film Festival in 2016 and have been desperate to see it again.

This is a frequent irritant for me. Just as short fiction is often the best medium for horror, short film when done well is magic. It's a real shame that so few get picked up for wider distribution. If you don't see them at a festival, you often don't see them at all.

With that said, here's a short list - in no particular order - of some of the shorts I saw at this year's Grimmfest that I particularly loved. Spoilers ahead. 

## Oldtimers

*Dir: Brian Quintero*

Two older men get together for drinks at Christmas. They're both experts in their field, artisans with long legacies, and it's the first time they've got in a room together. The chemistry between Conrad Coates and Julian Richings is wonderful, the pacing and slow drip of information is great, and the final reveal - that they're both slasher killers, they've broken into a home, and the couple who lived there are tied up in chairs waiting to die - is executed to perfection. 

The piece ends with a glorious scene where the should-be-retired killers discover they really are too old for this shit, in a sequence that demonstrates how close the line between good horror and good comedy is. Quintero is definitely one to watch.

## Ringworms

*Dir: Will Lee*

What a treat this was. A young couple go to stay in a holiday cottage for a week. When Abbie discovers that her boyfriend plans to propose she undergoes a mild crisis about their relationship and her future, which attracts the attention of the weird cult living in the basement. 

Very little is explained - which is fine, because explanations kill cosmic horror - but we have an old man in a chair who looks dead, weird maggot things writhing under Abbie's skin, an attempted resurrection via chanting around a crackly old TV, and a bloody climax that ruins everyone's plans. You could easily turn this into a 90 minute feature, but it doesn't need it at all.

## Unheimlich

*Dir: Fabio Colonna*

One of the standout films of the entire festival for me. A woman wakes up in an empty house during a storm. She runs down to the basement, where a twisted monstrosity pulls itself out of a mirror and chases her through the house until it catches and kills her. Then she wakes up, and the nightmare repeats again and again and again.

This is so stylish, a visual and auditory treat that evokes the best of silent film, campy monster movies, giallo flicks (the truly great stuff, Argento and Bara, not the schlocky pornos), and straight up surrealist nightmares. It looks amazing, it keeps the pacing and the tension right, and it gives nothing away. The score is gorgeous and Helena Puig gives a gripping performance without ever saying a word.
