Over at [Movies Review 101](https://moviesreview101.com/10-entry-level-horror-movies/?amp=1) Darren Lucas has compiled a list of 10 entry-level horror films - films you can show to your partner or friend who doesn't really like horror to help get their toes wet, so you can enjoy your passion for horror films with them during the most wonderful time of the year (that's October, if you didn't know).

I love the idea of this and I think it's largely a good list, but there are a few picks here that I personally think are misses. So I decided to try and build on it myself, taking the films I don't think work here and replacing them with things I think work better. First I'll go through the films I'd cut and explain why, and then I'll follow that with my replacements. I'll explain why I've made these choices, and I don't expect everyone to agree with me. Ask me again tomorrow and I probably won't agree with me, either.

I'm also not reproducing the entire list here. Go and read Darren's post to see that.

## Original Pick - Scream (1996)

This pains me, it really does. Scream is one of my favourite films and a hugely formative, important movie for me. I was 10 when it came out, 11 when it was released on video rental. My friend James had a Halloween party and his mum rented it so we could all watch it. Like any good parent she watched it first and decided that Drew Barrymore's cold open murder was tol much for the kids to watch, so she started the film after that had already happened. I think she (smartly) realised that a bunch of 11 year olds would get bored of the opening scenes with very few murders and go and do other things, meaning that we wouldn't see the party scene and the violence of the final act.

She was mostly right, but while everyone else went off to play party games I sat and watched the entire film on my own. I was already deep into horror at that point; I had a VHS collection of classic slashers that was my pride and joy, and Scream was one of the first really modern horror movies I'd seen (other than Candyman (1992) and Wes Craven's New Nightmare: The Best One (1994)). So when I got home I begged my mum to rent it for me so I could see the opening scene, and I sat and shouted at the screen as Casey got the question about Friday The 13th wrong because I knew the answer and I was *pissed*.

So yeah. Scream is a super important film for me. But I don't think it's a good on-ramp for horror. That may seem like a weird thing to say since it has very much served as an on-ramp for many people in my generation, but I think we can do better. It's at its most effective when you're already well versed in the tropes of the genre and you can engage with the para- and metatextual stuff that's going on. I've watched it with people who weren't into horror and they simply didn't enjoy it.

## Original Pick - Bones And All (2022)

Honestly? I just don't think it's a very good film. That may be a controversial opinion, I don't know, but I simply didn't enjoy it, and despite the theme of cannibalism and some fairly gory imagery I don't really think it qualifies as a horror film. (I hate the whole "is this or isn't this X genre" thing generally but I think when you're putting together a list of entry level items for a specific genre it suddenly becomes important.)

I have less to say about this one than Scream, frankly. It just wouldn't be on my list.

## Original Pick - Werewolves Within (2021)

95% of horror comedy is shit. I'll die on this hill. And I think if we're trying to onboard people to horror we should onboard them to *horror*. Otherwise you end up creating the kind of people who see someone asking for horror recommendations and tell you to watch Shaun Of The Dead (2004)

## Original Pick - My Name Is Bruce (2007)

It's a horror comedy that requires you to know who Bruce Campbell is and be relatively familiar with his work to get anything out of it at all. Yeah, Bruce has cult status and the Evil Dead series is really important for horror but I genuinely cannot understand why *this* is the pick. It's a perfectly okay film but it's nothing special, and if someone showed me this as a way to try and get into horror I'd never let them pick a film again.

## Original Pick - Anna And The Apocalypse

I'm very much letting my own tastes dictate what happens here, and that's fine because this is my blog and my list. "Musical horror" is right there next to "comedy horror" on my list of things that I really can't stand, and the fact that this is a gimmicky Christmas film as well also goes against it. It's pretty well regarded which means I'm probably wrong on this one but I just don't like it and so it's coming off the list. Sorry.

## The Replacements

I'm not going to try and make like-for-like replacements for everything here. Instead my goal is to try and replace the films I've pulled out with things that show off the variety and depth of horror. Part of introducing people to a new genre is in showing them everything it has to offer. ("But Chris," I hear you cry, "horror comedy and musical horror are part of what horror has to offer and you've removed any trace of them from your list! Isn't that hypocritical?" To which I respond, "Yes but they're shit, go away.")

## Replacement 1 - Bodies Bodies Bodies (2022)

A super smart, slick, modern slasher/murder mystery that's also laugh out loud funny in place. (One day I'll write my 5000 word opus on the difference between "horror comedy" and "actual horror films that are also incidentally funny" but that day is not today). Sure, some people might see the twist coming a mile away, but in a whodunnit like this that's always part of the fun.

This is one of those films that I think we'll look back on in a decade and talk about in the same sort of terms that we talk about Scream now. That's how good I think it is. It's got huge energy, some really great, memorable performances, and some properly tense scenes - plus some amazing kills and plenty of gore and violence without tipping over into extreme territory, which is what you want when you're introducing new people.

## Replacement 2 - The Others (2001)

Horror is a weird genre because it's often *not* a genre, it's something you drape over other genres to change them in fundamental ways. *The Others* does this beautifully, taking a quiet, claustrophobic period drama and twisting the dial marked "very creepy ghosts" until people cry.

This is one of those films that I don't hear very many people talk about these days but I consider it a classic in the haunted house genre. I went to see this in the cinema when I was 15 years old with people who absolutely were not into horror films and watched them be scared out of their minds for an hour and a half, to then walk out of the cinema absolutely gushing about what they'd just seen.

## Replacement 3 - The Omen (1976)

Something that's missing from the original list is what I guess we'd call "classic horror". My instinct was to include *The Exorcist* (1973) here, not only because it's fantastic but also because it's one of my all-time favourite films. Unfortunately I think that film has such a cultural weight that people who haven't seen it are still going to go into it with preconceptions of what it looks like (and there's also a good chance it's been ruined for them by that scene in *Scary Movie 2* (2001)). Then I considered *Rosemary's Baby* (1968) but fuck Roman Polanski.

So with those two removed the obvious choice is Richard Donner's *The Omen* (1976). Tonally it's in a similar space to both of those films, carried by a towering performance by Gregory Peck at his absolute best. I've never met anyone who didn't love this film and who didn't come away from it absolutely terrified of those fucking dogs. And if your friend who doesn't like horror loves this, there's a whole world of religious (let's be honest, Catholic) horror for them to delve into afterwards.

## Replacement 4 - Tucker and Dale vs. Evil (2010)

"But Chris, you don't like horror comedy! You said it's shit! You said you'd die on that hill!"

I said 95% of horror comedy is shit, and it is. *Tucker and Dale* is in the 5% that isn't. An absolute joy of a film, that plays with the tropes of backwoods horror in a way that doesn't assume you already know those tropes, and delivers plenty of laughs alongside plenty of great set-piece murders. Half the fun of this film is in looking at a set and thinking "I know exactly how this is going to go", in exactly the same way as the later *Final Destination* films - with the added benefit of not having to sit through all of the *Final Destination* films.

## Replacement 5 - X (2022)

At risk of leaning too heavily into the slasher genre, my final pick is Ti West's love letter to *The Texas Chain Saw Massacre* (1974). I have a love-hate relationship with West as a filmmaker, because he's clearly talented and has a lot to say about horror as a genre and film as a medium. Unfortunately he drops the ball more often than not, which I find deeply frustrating.

No balls were dropped during the making of *X* (I'll let you provide the obvious puns about balls and porn here). A properly effective slasher film that plays with the conventions of the genre while really exploring our cultural ideas around sex, age, and monstrosity. Everyone in it is great, too. People very fairly praise Mia Goth for her dual performances here, but Jenna Ortega and Brittany Snow command every single scene that they're in as well.
