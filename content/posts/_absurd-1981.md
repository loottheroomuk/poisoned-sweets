I started yesterday by watching most of the special features on the Blu-ray of Prano Bailiey-Bond's love-letter to video nasties, _Censor_ (2021). Among those extras are an interview with David Gregory, owner of Severin Films, about the video nasty era and censorship, alongside his two-part documentary about the era _Ban The Sadist Videos!_ (2005). 

In watching it I realised that I don't really know anything about the video nasties. I know of their existence and I've seen a couple of the more notable ones - _The Evil Dead_ (1981) and _Tenebrae_ (1982) - but the bulk of the list is unknown to me.

I'm going to fix that.

The plan is to watch all 72 video nasties in the order they're presented [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls051364249/), or as close to it as I can. I have no time frame for this but I'll be writing about them as and when I see them.

## Absurd (1981)

We start at the start, with Joe D'Amato's 1981 movie _Absurd_. This has a ton of different titles. Its Italian title is _Rosso Sangue_ or _Red Blood_. It's also known as _Anthropophagus 2_, _Zombie 6: Monster Hunter_, _Horrible_, and _The Grim Reaper 2_. From what I understand it was intended to be a sequel to _Anthropophagus_ (1980). There's certainly nothing in the film that makes me think I've missed anything by not seeing the first movie, although maybe I'll find out more about the Greek priest who features in this film? _Anthropophagus_ is third on the list of video nasties, so I won't have long to wait.

I watched this on Amazon Video and I have no idea if it's been cut in any way or if this is the full version. A brief amount of research tells me that the film was passed uncut by the BBFC in 2016, but you never know which version you're getting with Amazon.

At its core, _Absurd!_ is a pretty formulaic slasher movie. We have a seemingly indestructible killer, a man who comes into town from outside to help the police hunt the killer, and a string of grisly murders. It does do some things differently, though.

For starters, we get a good look at our killer right at the start of the film. The picture opens on a scene of a large man being chased through a park by another man in a long black coat (I initially thought of the chaser, "is he a priest?" for no real reason; it turns out that he is, indeed, a priest). In an attempt to escape his pursuer the large man tries to climb the metal gate  to a house. It's topped with spikes, which pierce his stomach. A few minutes later he turns up at the door of the house and literally spills his guts all over the floor in the first bit of on-screen gore in the movie.

The next time we see the man he's on the operating table, his stomach wound being prodded and poked by a surgeon. We see lots of shots of his open wound and wet, lumpy flesh, but it's no more upsetting than anything you'd see in an episode of _M*A*S*H_. The surgeons worry that we're losing him, but after injecting him with adrenaline everything changes. We learn that his blood coagulates faster than it should, that his body is knitting itself together at an inhuman rate, and that it's like he was never wounded in the first place. One of the surgeons declares that it's "Absurd!" - and who doesn't love it when someone says the name of the movie in the first ten minutes?

That's when the killings start. The monster sees the man who was chasing him and flies into a rage that ends with him murdering a nurse by drilling into her skull with a surgical drill. The shots linger on the drill penetrating her skin, spraying blood from the wound as she screams in pain and terror. Shortly afterwards we see her dead on the floor, the drill forced all the way through her head so that it emerges from the opposite side.

This begins a back and forth sequence that takes us through most of the film. The beast kills, then we cut to the police and the mysterious Greek man - who we have learned is a priest - discussing the killer and trying to work out where he'll go next, always one step behind. We learn that the beast's body regenerates perfectly but that his brain doesn't; once the grey matter is damaged it stays damaged, and that the only way to properly kill him is to destroy his brain. We also learn that our priest "serve[s] God with biochemistry more than rites", which has become one of my all-time favourite lines in horror.

Given that it's an official video nasty, the gore and violence on display here is much less than I expected. Our next kill is, admittedly, pretty violent - a cleaner is pushed skull-first into a table saw - but when the beast takes down a member of the motorcycle gang that's been terrorising the town, he chokes him out on the road and drags the body off into the bushes in a surprisingly restrained sequence. I was expecting needless escalation and gratuitous gore, but it never materialises.

It's after this kill that the pacing of the film really drops off a cliff. The beast comes to the house we saw at the start and begins stalking to occupants., prowling around the outside of the house and eventually breaking in after killing the babysitter with a spiked axe to the head.

It's a shame that this is where the film almost falls apart, because it's at this point that it looks its best. Some of the shots outside the house are reminiscent of John Carpenter's _Halloween_ (1978), as we watch the house from the shadows in a shaky first person point of view. We really feel like we're in the head of a killer stalking his prey.

The longer we spend inside the house the more it starts to feel like an homage to _Halloween_, from the framing of shots to the lighting and even music cues in the quieter moments when we're not being treated to an onslaught of '80s drums and synth organs. It, of course, never comes close to being as good as Carpenter, but it's still fun despite the slacking pace at this point.

Part of the reason that the pacing dies here is that it's the longest the film goes without a kill, which are without doubt the most fun parts of the movie. Things start to pick up again when the beast forces Mrs. Bennett head first into an oven, though as with the biker murder earlier this isn't the gore fest we might hope it to be. We get lots of teasing shots of the open gas flames at the back of the oven and might expect her to burst into a great conflagration after losing her struggle with the beast, but it's not to be. Instead, after she's sweating and half-asphyxiated, the beast pulls her out and stabs her once in the throat.

There's a good sequence right at the end where the beast is hunting previously bed-bound Katia around the house, completely blind after she pokes out his eyes. It's effective and tense and also quite funny as he stumbles around after her, flailing his arms and barely missing the top of her head as she hides in corners. The final kill comes after the police and our priest finally arrive. The priest is dispatched, brutally choked to death, and Katia sees her moment, picking up and axe and hacking the beast's head off.

It's a fun final moment, but it's also a final disappointment. The beheading looks set to deliver a huge amount of gore, but we cut away after the first strike. We do, however, end on a very fun moment as Katia answers the door to the house in her blood-soaked night gown, holding up the beast's severed head with a smile as she says, "you don't need to be afraid anymore."

## The Verdict

Is _Absurd_ a good film? Definitely not.

Did I enjoy it? Absolutely.

It's short and sweet and wears its influences on its sleeve. At its best it's an effective pseudo-supernatural slasher movie. At its worst its simply boring, but those moments don't last long. There aren't any standout performances to speak of and the effects are simply fine, but they're certainly not _bad_ and it's a perfectly enjoyable watch.

Best line: "The bogeyman's back, I just saw him in the kitchen!"

If you're expecting a classic, avoid it. If you want to be entertained and to laugh at some silly deaths, give it a go.
