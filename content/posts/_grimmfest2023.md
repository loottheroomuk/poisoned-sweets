This past weekend I attended the 15th [Grimmfest](https://www.grimmfest.com/), Manchester's independent horror film festival. I've been going to it since the early days when it was known as GRIMM UP NORTH, though it's only in the last couple of years that I've been able to get a full pass and go for the entire festival rather than just seeing a film or two. It's very much one of the highlights of my year.

---

In a break from tradition this year's festival was mostly programmed by Leonie Rowland from the Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies, Dr. Linnie Blake, founder of the Manchester Centre for Gothic Studies and co-convener of the **Monsters & Movies** symposium in 2022 (which was excellent). Personally I definitely felt the presence of new eyes and tastes in the programming this year. There was a much stronger focus on films from non-male directors and on screening films that dealt with issues of bodily autonomy and the danger/threat of masculine and patriarchal power. Although I felt like the programming leaned more in the direction of thrillers than what I would term 'proper horror films' (could this be any more subjective if it tried? Probably not) this was one of the most consistently quality lineups in recent memory. There may have been fewer films that really jumped out at me and made me desperate to see them again than in the past, but similarly there were none that I hated. There's usually at least one film over the weekend where I decide to leave the theatre during the screening in order to go and eat something or stretch my legs, and despite occasionally miserable conditions of sweltering heat caused by malfunctioning air-conditioning in the screen (not the fault of the Grimmfest organisers) I watched everything in its entirety this year.

Here are my highlights from the weekend, in no particular order. There will be spoilers here, I'm sure of it.

# The Shorts Programme

I love short form horror and I always look forward to the shorts programme at Grimm. In writing this post my temptation was to pick 5 films as my favourites from the festival and then mention the shorts in brief at the end, but I honestly think the shorts programming as a whole was my highlight of the weekend. So here it is, first on the list.

This year's was the biggest shorts programme I can remember (90 minutes of shorts each day plus an anthology film on day 2, which I'm counting as part of the shorts programme even if the organisers didn't) and it was easily the strongest I've ever seen at the festival. Some of my top films from the entire weekend came from the shorts. Highlights:

## Memories Of The Moon

*(Dir. Antoine Dricot)*    
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/CsQk)*

The moon is rising for the first time in 21 years, and time is going to pass differently for everyone who experiences it. Nobody knows if they'll actually survive the night, and people flock together to party like it's the end of the world - because it might be. When Élodie (Maily Dumon) meets Sophia (Sophie Maréchal) at a party they begin an intense relationship that slowly begins to crumble under the weight of living in assymetrical time, and the historic trauma of Élodie's last experience of moonrise.

Beautifully shot and scored, brilliantly acted, it's quiet, intense, funny, yet tragic and heartbreaking in equal measure.

## Variations On A Theme

*(Dir. Peter Collins Campbell)*  
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/FPqA)*

Sam (Sophia Dunn-Walker) and Mark (Peter Collins Campbell) have got a problem - they split up, and they keep splitting up. Literally. Every day this week their bodies have split in two, creating copies of themselves that keep living out the events of the day they were made on. They've mostly got a handle on it, but now a new copy of Sam has appeared and they don't know where she came from.

This is a very, very silly idea played entirely straight (though still with moments of humour). It's really well made, with great performances from the two leads who are often sharing the screen with multiple copies of themselves. It doesn't waste any time establishing what's going on and getting to the problem, and it ends with some really gross, effective, incredibly *wet* practical effects that I loved.

## Mantra

*(Dir. Pascal Bourelier & Stef Meyer)*    
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/Azl0)*

Immediately after watching this film I wrote a Letterboxd review that says, "What if Gregor Samsa was a hot French woman?" and honestly that's about all you need to really know about this film. Paul (Raphaël Quenard) collects bugs, which he pins to boards and frames. Emma (Maud Wyler) thinks it's a bit weird but tolerates it anyway.

When Paul goes away and leaves Emma with a praying mantis destined for his pins, Emma becomes obsessed with it. Over the course of the weekend she develops an intense relationship with it, releasing it from its tank and giving it complete access to both her house and her body. As the house transforms itself into a sweaty jungle environment so too does Emma's body begin to change, all building towards Paul coming home and a violent, almost erotic final scene that won't be any surprise if you know anything about female praying mantises.

There's nothing unexpected here really, but it looks and sounds amazing and Wyler's performance is great. There's a real emotional weight and intensity to the scenes between Emma and the mantis that's often lacking in scenes between two human actors, which is possibly the most impressive part of the whole thing.

## Family Night

*(Dir. Alan Dunne)*    
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/ISqY)*

A short slice of domestic horror in a mid-90s Ireland where divorce isn't legal. We're dropped into an incredibly tense dinner during a weekly family night, as a mother (Denise McCormack) and her children try to navigate the short temper and mercurial moods of the father (Eoin Quinn). We advance hour by hour, watching the family try to maintain a semblance of normality and calm as the tension mounts along with the creeping sense that something isn't quite right.

It's hard to talk about the final sequence without spoiling the whole thing, so I won't, but the reveal of what's going on is chilling and throws everything we've just seen into stark new context. All of the performances are great, and Quinn exudes an air of barely-contained menace that makes this really uncomfortable to watch.

## Scratch

*(Dir. Michael Trainotti)*   
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/GDtE)

A father and son go on a weekend camping trip to spend some time together and bond, only to find themselves hunted by a ferocious monster that's out for blood. It's a very simple setup and the nature of the threat is fairly obvious, but what's special about **Scratch** is the way it's executed.

It looks amazing and it's paced brilliantly, but where this really shines is in a great script that's performed brilliantly by the father and son who are played by an actual father and son (unfortunately they're not credited anywhere I can find them and I didn't make any notes while watching this, so I don't know what their names are). These are genuinely two of the best performances I've ever seen in a short film, and it's because of the performances that you have such an emotional investment in what is on the surface a very by-the-numbers story.

There are a couple of moments where things could be better to really hammer home that emotional core and the coming-of-age theme that's present here. Early on in the film the dad teaches his son how to swing an axe and there's a real missed opportunity when the son doesn't later make use of that when fighting off the monster, but that's a small quibble in an otherwise great film. I'd watch a feature from this team in a heartbeat.

# Suitable Flesh

*(Dir. Joe Lynch)*  
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/C3VE)*

The first feature of the weekend set the bar incredibly high. Heather Graham is having the time of her life here, and her energy infuses the entire thing alongside some equally great performances from Barbara Crampton and Judah Lewis.

Lovecraftian cosmic horror is hard to get right on screen, and this might be my new favourite example of how to do it well. It's creepy and tense, funny, shocking, and gross, but also incredibly horny in a way that feels almost dangerous. It's an absolute credit to the cast that the nameless demon who inhabits everyone's body at one point or another felt like the same character every time no matter who was currently playing it.

I went into this knowing absolutely nothing about it other than the title and had the best time. The end is a little bit messy and discards the rules that have been really well established up to that point (namely that you have to be able to hear the words being spoken for the body swap to happen), but by the time that happened I was fully along for the ride and didn't care. See this at your first opportunity.

# Door

*(Dir. Banmei Takahashi)*   
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/egQY)*

When Third Window announced the Blu-ray release of *Door* (as well as the first sequel) I very nearly snapped it up immediately, but I decided to wait because I wanted my first viewing of Takahashi's lost home invasion thriller to be on the big screen with a packed audience. I'm really glad I made that decision.

The first hour or so is a real slow burn, a perfect example of that mundane domestic horror/threat that's so pervasive in Japanese cinema. You get the very real sense that no matter what happens, Yasuko's (Keiko Takahashi) neighbours absolutely won't be there for her and that she's going to have to deal with this problem entirely on her own.

Once things really kick off it's absolutely unhinged. By the end of the screening people were cheering and shouting at the screen, and I honestly can't remember the last time I had this much fun watching a film. It's ridiculous and funny while also still carrying that very real sense of malice and threat right up to the very end. The final chase sequence, with the salesman pursuing Yasuko through her maze-like apartment while the camera tracks them from above, is an incredible piece of film making. It's breathlessly tense, and the moment when Yasuko finally reaches for the chainsaw we saw right at the start of the film and which she was tormented by in a sequence that feels deliberately too long, is practically euphoric. This was an absolute treat.

# The Coffee Table

*(Dir. Caye Casas)*  
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/DY2e)*

It's so hard to talk about this film without spoiling it, and spoiling it would be criminal. Go into this knowing as little about it as you possibly can.

This is one of those really special films that manages to be laugh-out-loud hilarious while simultaneously making you feel like a terrible person for finding it funny. It's the blackest of black comedies, a hysterical farce that's also as unsettlingly, anxiety-inducingly tense as anything the Safdie brothers have ever made. There's a moment that the entire film hinges around that silenced the cinema and changed the tone in the screen in a way I haven't experienced since **that bit** in *Hereditary* (2018).

It's not perfect - it suffers from a flabby second act that spends a little too much time laying it on thick. There's one scene in particular in a child's bedroom talking about toys that I think outstays its welcome and kills some of the pace, and I don't think it particularly adds anything that would be lost if that sequence were to be trimmed dramatically or removed entirely. Similarly the final shots feel a little unnecessary when we had a perfect ending a few moments earlier. But overall this was fantastic, and it's a film I'll be thinking about for a long time.

# What You Wish For

*(Dir. Nicholas Tomnay)* 
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/GByC)*

It's deeply flawed and riddled with plot holes but I absolutely do not care. Why does the cover story require the chef to pretend to be anything other than a chef? Why don't this mysterious, powerful company with seemingly unlimited resources who implant GPS trackers in their employees have any record of what their employees actually look like? Why do the security team keep letting random people walk up to the house? None of it matters because the film is a ton of fun and you absolutely don't need any of this stuff to make sense (although I'm still irrationally annoyed by the fact that nobody involved in the production seems to know anything about wine).

This isn't the first film that deals with the monstrosity of wealthy people who can indulge their most perverse whims, or with the way that corporations justify the damage that they do to the world and the people they impact, and it certainly won't be the last. It's an interesting twist to show us a main character who jumps into the world with both feet in an attempt to rub shoulders with the rich and influential only to find himself trapped in this new life with no way out other than his own death. At the end of the film you get a sense that maybe he's resigned to this now, that he can make peace with what he's going to spend the rest of his life doing because it's better than the alternative of being poor and bored. That sort of moral ambiguity in a protagonist isn't something you see often outside of films where those grey morals are the entire point, and I liked it. 

This is by no means an amazing film but I enjoyed it a lot and I think it could very easily become a comfort watch for me. I think my favourite thing about it is the realisation that we never actually find out why Ryan was invited to visit his friend in the first place, and what the eventual reveal about the nature of the meal implies about the reasons for that invitation. I'm keen to see this again and I'll definitely be looking out for any hints in their conversations that point to the reveal a little earlier in the film. I also won't be at all surprised if they're not there, and that won't impact my enjoyment of the film at all.

# Deleter

*(Dir. Mikhail Red)*  
*[Letterboxd](https://boxd.it/BK5u)*

I think this was my favourite film of the festival as a whole, just beating out *Suitable Flesh* for the top spot. A slow burn chiller about a content moderator for an unnamed social network, it starts out as an eerie psychological thriller and rapidly turns into a creepy, tense supernatural revenge flick.

The absolute star of this film is Nadine Lustre's Lyra: a woman on the edge of burnout, great at her job because she's able to detach herself emotionally from the work but slowly realising that her this detachment is pushing away friends and any sort of support structure that she desperately needs. Lustre's performance is quiet and restrained, which stands in stark contrast to the violent and upsetting footage she - and through her, we - is exposed to on a daily basis.

As the film builds to its climax we learn that Lyra was complicit in the events that led to the death of her friend, whose spirit has now returned to take revenge on those who wronged her, and we start to realise along with Lyra that her too-late apology isn't going to be enough to help her evade punishment. My only criticism of the film is that this theme was already incredibly clear and Lyra's fate - alongside that of office manager Simon (Jeffrey Hidalgo) - made complete sense without needing the addition of a rape scene very late in the third act. The rest of the film had already proved that we don't need to default to rape to show that a man is a piece of shit, and I didn't feel it added anything to the film other than padding out the run time a little. 

Still, this was really effective and one of the only 'proper horror' films of this year's festival, and I'm absolutely going to be seeking out Mikhail Red's other work.
